# Orangetheory Fitness - Customer Sentiment on Lift45 Course and Fitness Metrics

## About the Project
This project aimed to delve into customer sentiment and feedback surrounding the Lift45 course offered by Orangetheory Fitness (OTF), as well as OTF metrics related to fitness performance such as splat points, heart rate zones, and max heart rates. My focus platforms for data collection were Reddit and Facebook, as they boast significant Orangetheory Fitness communities.

### Data Collection and Analysis
To gather insights, I utilized the Reddit API to extract posts, comments, and replies pertaining to Lift45 and fitness metrics. Key data points including date, author, title, and text body were collected. Leveraging the ChatGPT API, I categorized feedback into top themes for both Lift45 and fitness metrics. Each Reddit post, comment, and reply was then analyzed with the ChatGPT API, generating essential data points such as sentiment (positive/negative/neutral), summary, and category of feedback.

### Data Visualization
The analyzed data was visualized using Tableau, presenting percentages of customers with positive, neutral, and negative sentiments toward Lift45 and OTF fitness metrics. Additionally, I quantified top feedback categories and their respective sentiments, highlighting areas necessitating attention and improvement.

### Recommendations and Presentations
Based on the insights uncovered, I crafted data-driven recommendations aimed at refining class structure, enriching course content, and optimizing metric tracking methodologies. Qualitative feedback, data visualizations, and actionable recommendations were consolidated into a comprehensive slide deck and delivered to the project supervisor. The goal was to catalyze positive change and elevate customer satisfaction through informed decision-making.
