3,2023/7/23,Lift45,Two different people borrowed from my station today. Lift45 format small rant.,Reddit,cindobeast,negative,"The author expresses frustration with the new format of Lift45 classes, where there are more participants and no designated floor sections, leading to the need to borrow weights and inconvenience.","Before in Lift45 classes we would all have a station and do Floor side first then Rower side exercises. Lately they've allowed more than 16 people to sign up so all floor stations had members plus like 4-5 people who start near the rowers. When we switch those 4-5 people take stations 1-5 and then those folks move to rower side of the gym. So when you don't have a designated floor section you have no choice but to ask people to borrow weights. We had 4 extra people but 2 of them borrowed from mine! They asked and we're nice and all that so it's not a rant against them we'll except one girl who borrowed 20s said she'd bring them back but never did lol. I was able to work with what I could find near me, but if I wanted to go 20s no one near me had them free anyway so it was just a little annoying and I blame it more of this new format than anything. Anyone else have this format at their lift?",course availability

5,2023/7/23,Lift45,Re: Two different people borrowed from my station today. Lift45 format small rant.,Reddit,mikeseese,negative,The author expresses frustration with the lack of available weights during Lift45 classes and believes that the studios are not equipped to handle the number of people on the weight floor.,"Unfortunately, a lack of the weight you need during a lift 45 is not uncommon. I find myself struggling to find 20s frequently as the other group is using them for the heavier leg exercises when I need them for some of my arm exercises. I also struggle to find heavier weights because a good chunk of us use them; for example I needed a 50 for a goblet squat but had to opt for two 30s in a normal squat. If I can't find any (after asking the coach too), I either try to push forward with a heavier weight or go much slower with a lighter weight. The studios aren't equipped for 14+ people on the weight floor; I don't see this changing any time soon.",course availability

If anyone needs heavier or lighter weights, we just ask the coach and they'll retrieve them for us. Or while the rower side is being explained, the floor side is told to look at the screen and see what weights they will need for that particular block then the rower side comes and gets what they need.",coaching

I'm not a registered dietician, but like others have said..eat at a caloric deficit and aim for more protein throughout the day (ie: 30-40 g per meal. I'm currently aiming for 1 g protein per lb of body weight). This will help stimulate mTOR aka muscle growth. Many studies on pubmed have shown that eating more protein while eating in a caloric deficit will help maintain muscle mass and result in more fat loss compared to lower protein diets (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26817506/). More Lift45 classes make sense for your goal. If your form is great at OTF, don't be afraid to lift heavy and until failure. If it's not that great, make sure your coach can give you feedback, otherwise you can injure yourself. If you're interested in learning more about protein and body composition, I love this podcast! https://youtu.be/BqmG2y4IeY8 Keep in mind that body recomp will take time, so try to focus on NSV (ie: waist measurements, how your clothes fit, how fast you can run, how heavy you can lift, etc).

Depending on how busy my Sunday is sometimes I end up going to a studio that does Lift then Regular and sometimes I am at a studio that does Regular then Lift. Either way you can't go wrong you just have to prepare yourself and set some expectations. 1H45Ms of working out is a long time so I like to prep my body and my mind. I usually will take around 3/4 of my regular preworkout serving before the first class and then take the final 1/4 before the second class to keep me going. I also enjoy taking a small snack or a bottle with protein in it to keep me going for the next class. Additionally, I think it is important to prep your mind and determine what your goal is with the two classes. For example, I usually treat the first class (no matter if it is Lift or Regular) as a sort of long warm-up for the next class. Then the second class is really where I start going hard. For this reason I usually prefer Lift to be the second class as I personally think that it is more important to be warm/prepped for a Lift class compared to a Regular class but that is just me.",course relationship

Plus, I feel like building strength is a much more important goal for me now than burning calories. Funnily enough, I have burned almost as many calories in the Lift45 classes as I did in the regular 2G classes, and I always get over 12 splats in them (not that it really matters). It's interesting cause no one else in the class seems to get anywhere near as many calories burnt or splats. I guess I'll chalk that up to my being really weak lol. The treadmill has never felt very challenging to me. Of course I could always run faster with steeper inclines, but I feel like I'm pretty satisfied with my speed and incline on the tread, and I'm not trying to lose weight. When I did 2G classes, most of my orange was in the floor/rower portion, and I stayed mostly green on the tread except when doing AOs. I like that the coaches provide more feedback on form in the Lift45 classes cause they're not so busy running back and forth between the treads and the floor. I will probably go back to 2G classes in the winter when it's too crappy outside to want to run, but for now it's working really well for me to just do Lift45 and go for runs outside. The only thing I feel like I'm missing out on is the rower (even though there's not much rowing in 2G classes) but I HATE the rower even though I know it's good for me, so I'm not shedding too many tears about that.

It's interesting cause no one else in the class seems to get anywhere near as many calories burnt or splats. I guess I'll chalk that up to my being really weak lol.

My splats drop off some when I start on the rower in a 3G, and drastically when I start on the floor. This is because the treadmill gets my heart rate up into the green and keeps it up for a sustained period of time, and I will sustain that the rest of class if I start there. On the flipside, when I start on the floor, Im often going from gray or low blue into green when my heart rate spikes even though the intensity feels the same. For example, I started on the treads and got 30 splats in yesterdays class, which had a lot of walking recovery, mixed in with 10 all outs. I pushed myself hard to run as fast as possible during the all-outs, and I was cruising in the high green when I switched to the rower, and the 50 stroke row just kept that going. So by the time I got to the floor, which was very low intensity, and did not feel difficult, even small spikes kept me going back into orange. I would not have rated yesterdays work out as insane even though I got a ton of splats. However, today I started on the floor and only got 9 splats for the class even though I felt like it was a harder overall template both with the floor work (especially the first block), and the exhausting inclines on the treads.

So, instead of obsessing over zones and splats, look at the actual data behind it and use that data in class to meet your goals. For me, thats knowing that when I drop into the low 130s during a walking recovery, its time to pick it back up to base pace again.

The value for Max Heart Rate is a point of contention, especially since OTF changed their formula a year ago. So in other words, take Splat Points with a grain of salt. Meanwhile, calories burned is based on gender, weight, and actual heart rate over time. So this will care less about MHR and more what your actual is. So if your actual heart rate in class is high (absolute value, not percentage of MHR) , it will likely mean more calories estimated to be burned. Two, back when I used the OTF HRM, I put it on my right forearm, near my elbow a couple finger widths towards my wrist, with the sensor on the inside of the arm. I found that worked great and had little issues. Could always try moving it around. If you are curious about MHR estimates versus what OTF calculates, could always compare these formulas against what OTF has for you. Note that ALL of these are just estimates, short of doing something in a controlled lab environment, you won't be able to exactly determine it. Age and genetic lottery drive MHR, not fitness. Fox Formula: 220-age Hunt Formula: 211 - (0.64 * age) Tanaka Formula: 208 - (0.7 * age) Another Formula: 208.609 - (0.716 * age)",metric tracking

First, my average time spent in the 84% and above heart rate range is 18-21ish minutes, sometimes more, sometimes less. I burn 400-450 calories (according to OTF, my watch measures slightly less). For comparison, my fianc will do the same workout as me, same amount of time in the 84%+ range, and burn nearly twice as many calories as me. We are both in great shape, but he weighs about 45 lbs more than me. Men just burn more calories. It would be unhealthy for me to burn much more than what I currently doI just dont have that many calories to burn in an hour. Im an instructor at another large group fitness program, and I burn about 500 calories in those classes, and I am *wiped out* after that. The other thing is to pay less attention to the orange or red and splats, more attention to your actual heart rate. I cross from green to orange at 142bpm, and orange to red at 155bpm. Lets say I spend 7 minutes of a tread block at 142-144bpmthat will show as 7 splats. However, I could spend those same 7 minutes at 141, and they would all be in the green. But, that 1-2 bpm difference is going to produce almost the same calorie burn. That could be why you see people with fewer splats, but higher calories. Because they were working at the very top end of green (which is my fiancs goal about once a weekall green, still 700 calories). So, pay attention to your actual heart rate, and try to work in the lower end of your orange zone instead of the higher end of your green, if you want more splats. My heart rate also plummets the moment we go into a walking recoveryred to green very quickly. I set my walking recovery to 4.0, and usually kick back up to my base before the WR is over if my heart rate drops below 130.",workout strategies

For a HIIT workout to be effective, which is not measured by calories burned, you need to be in those zones a certain amount of time, regardless of your average heart rate.

It's a rough approximation of various different aerobic zones and a form of gamification of the workout.

It also suggests working by feel and waiting for the algorithm to settle for better results. The post mentions that certain workout templates generate more splats, while others may result in lower splats due to fluctuating heart rate.","So splats are based on HR%. HR% is a function of your max HR (100 * HR/maxHR) - this is the number that will affect your splats. When you first start at OTF, your max HR is set via age-based max HR formula. After 5 classes, you switch to the personalized max HR algorithm. None of us have seen it, but it uses your HR data recorded from class. Neither of these methods is perfect. If one's max HR is set too low, they'll see more splats. It's also possible they'll see their HR above 100% on AOs. Similarly, if one's max HR is too high, they might have a hard time getting splats. If you're relatively new, you might need to wait for the algorithm to get more data for you. It looks at your most recent 20 classes. I'd suggest working by feel (base: can have a brief conversation, can recover after push; push: can't speak more than 1-2 words at a time; AO: can't speak) and waiting to see if the algorithm settles out to a better max HR for you. And some classes will generate more splats just based on the templates. Anything with sustained hard efforts (like a lot of benchmarks and signature workouts) will generally end up this way. Templates with lots of AOs + WRs will often be low splats because your HR is going up and down and up and down all through class, not staying up.",metric tracking

If you're less fit, your HR spikes harder at lower speeds/weights but if your intensity is high, you'll get splats. If you're more fit, it takes higher speeds/weights to get that same spike, but it's still a question of intensity. If you don't adjust your workout, more fitness will reduce your splats, but you're getting less out of your time if you don't keep the intensity up. Personally, I think more fitness and experience potentially opens the door to higher splats. This is less about fitness and more about getting accustomed to intensity, but since they often go together... Basically if you can maintain a high HR longer, that's an impressive feat. It's not always your goal, but I like experimenting with where I can hold my HR without having to back off sometimes as a test. So many guidelines are about what's going to most efficiently burn calories that recommendations are hard to narrow down from general guidance to specific, but ultimately I don't think you should be afraid of high HR numbers (barring any health issues). The point of paying for something like OTF is to take a degree of thinking out of your hands, so if you successfully can follow the programming you're either right on target or can go harder no matter what the monitor says. If you go too hard, you'll have to recover when the programming says otherwise. Experiment with it. Find your limits and push them occasionally. That will help the monitor figure out what your max is better and help you learn how you should be feeling with different workouts. Also don't compare a one hour HIIT class to something longer or steady state like running a marathon when figuring out HR goals. Extremely different modalities there.",workout progress

The author also mentions the possibility of having a set max HR that is too high, making it difficult to reach the orange and red heart rate zones.","Are you using an armband HRM? Armband HRMs are notoriously finicky on rowing machines. With the constant flexing/relaxing of arm muscles, it can struggle to get a good read. Some things that can help are to play with placement and make sure you have a properly relaxed grip. You don't need to tightly grip the handle. Just hook your fingers over the handle and 'hang' off it like you hang off a pull-up bar. And as another user said, make sure you're really using your legs. Legs are big muscles, and when they're working hard, they'll get your HR up. In general, on the treads, you might need to increase your base pace. My coaches often recommend we get back to base from WR after our HR is green again. I usually try to have my base pace keep my HR around 80%. Then there isn't a whole lot of ground to cover to get into orange. Some days, if I start on the tread, I might add an extra little bit of speed or incline on the first push to help get my HR up initially, then it usually stays up for the rest of class. Do you get into orange on pushes? Do you feel like you're in a push effort, like you couldn't speak more than 1-2 words at a time? It's possible that your max HR is set too high, which will make it hard for you to get into orange and red (HR% is calculated as a percentage of your max HR). If you feel like your efforts are appropriate (can recover and could carry on a terse conversation in base, only speak a couple words at a time in push, can't talk in AO), then just keep going by feel.

If your heart is getting stronger you may be experiencing a faster heart rate recovery when going to base or WR. The calorie equation uses heart rate each second to determine total calorie burn over the course of the workout.

It mentions that the age-based formula and personalized algorithm have their limitations. It suggests waiting for the algorithm to settle for a better max HR and mentions that certain workout templates generate more splats. Overall, the sentiment is neutral, providing information and suggestions.","So splats are based on HR%. HR% is a function of your max HR (100 * HR/maxHR) - this is the number that will affect your splats. When you first start at OTF, your max HR is set via age-based max HR formula. After 5 classes, you switch to the personalized max HR algorithm. None of us have seen it, but it uses your HR data recorded from class. Neither of these methods is perfect. If one's max HR is set too low, they'll see more splats. It's also possible they'll see their HR above 100% on AOs. Similarly, if one's max HR is too high, they might have a hard time getting splats. If you're relatively new, you might need to wait for the algorithm to get more data for you. It looks at your most recent 20 classes. I'd suggest working by feel (base: can have a brief conversation, can recover after push; push: can't speak more than 1-2 words at a time; AO: can't speak) and waiting to see if the algorithm settles out to a better max HR for you. And some classes will generate more splats just based on the templates. Anything with sustained hard efforts (like a lot of benchmarks and signature workouts) will generally end up this way. Templates with lots of AOs + WRs will often be low splats because your HR is going up and down and up and down all through class, not staying up.",metric tracking

990,2023/7/4,HR and splats,Re: Splats?,Reddit,dray_m,positive,"The post discusses the relationship between fitness level, intensity, and splat points, emphasizing the importance of maintaining intensity for optimal results. The author encourages experimentation and finding personal limits to improve workout performance.","Anecdotally, number of splats has little to do with fitness. If you're less fit, your HR spikes harder at lower speeds/weights but if your intensity is high, you'll get splats. If you're more fit, it takes higher speeds/weights to get that same spike, but it's still a question of intensity. If you don't adjust your workout, more fitness will reduce your splats, but you're getting less out of your time if you don't keep the intensity up. Personally, I think more fitness and experience potentially opens the door to higher splats. This is less about fitness and more about getting accustomed to intensity, but since they often go together... Basically if you can maintain a high HR longer, that's an impressive feat. It's not always your goal, but I like experimenting with where I can hold my HR without having to back off sometimes as a test. So many guidelines are about what's going to most efficiently burn calories that recommendations are hard to narrow down from general guidance to specific, but ultimately I don't think you should be afraid of high HR numbers (barring any health issues). The point of paying for something like OTF is to take a degree of thinking out of your hands, so if you successfully can follow the programming you're either right on target or can go harder no matter what the monitor says. If you go too hard, you'll have to recover when the programming says otherwise. Experiment with it. Find your limits and push them occasionally. That will help the monitor figure out what your max is better and help you learn how you should be feeling with different workouts. Also don't compare a one hour HIIT class to something longer or steady state like running a marathon when figuring out HR goals. Extremely different modalities there.",workout strategies

The author also mentions the possibility of having a set max HR that is too high, making it difficult to reach the orange and red heart rate zones. The sentiment of the post is neutral, providing helpful advice without expressing strong positive or negative feelings.","Are you using an armband HRM? Armband HRMs are notoriously finicky on rowing machines. With the constant flexing/relaxing of arm muscles, it can struggle to get a good read. Some things that can help are to play with placement and make sure you have a properly relaxed grip. You don't need to tightly grip the handle. Just hook your fingers over the handle and 'hang' off it like you hang off a pull-up bar. And as another user said, make sure you're really using your legs. Legs are big muscles, and when they're working hard, they'll get your HR up. In general, on the treads, you might need to increase your base pace. My coaches often recommend we get back to base from WR after our HR is green again. I usually try to have my base pace keep my HR around 80%. Then there isn't a whole lot of ground to cover to get into orange. Some days, if I start on the tread, I might add an extra little bit of speed or incline on the first push to help get my HR up initially, then it usually stays up for the rest of class. Do you get into orange on pushes? Do you feel like you're in a push effort, like you couldn't speak more than 1-2 words at a time? It's possible that your max HR is set too high, which will make it hard for you to get into orange and red (HR% is calculated as a percentage of your max HR). If you feel like your efforts are appropriate (can recover and could carry on a terse conversation in base, only speak a couple words at a time in push, can't talk in AO), then just keep going by feel.

Is this something you want to do? That aside, when it comes to running, taking half a block to feel comfortable is normal. When I'm running, it takes me 5-10 minutes to properly settle in. First I have to go through the phase where I feel short of breath and my HR might spike (sometimes it stay super low, sometimes it spikes). Once my body accepts that yes, we're really doing this, everything settles down and I can comfortably run at base pace for some time. But there's always that initial warm-up/transition period I have to push through before I get comfortable. So perhaps you could try pushing through that shortness of breath? You can do this at base pace rather than push, and you always have the option to stop if it gets to be too much, but maybe make it a goal to last X seconds longer than last time before you walk.

Always go based off your feelings, not the HR zone or splats. Did you walk out wishing you wouldve gone faster or used heavier weights? Guess what? You get to come back and try harder next time. Whats important is that you showed up for you and did what you could based on how you felt that day. Some days the workouts are going to be hard either because of the template or all the things that could impact your ability at the time of the workout. You get to choose your adventure every day. If your legs feel great and you want to pick up the speed then YAY! If your legs are not up for a run and you raise the incline then YAY!",workout strategies
1161,2023/6/4,HR and splats,Re: Zone 3- Green zone,Reddit,KinvaraSarinth,neutral,"The post provides tips and strategies for increasing the challenge during workouts at Orangetheory, including increasing speed and inclines. The author encourages trial and error to figure out the best speeds and inclines. No specific feedback or sentiment about splat points, max HR, heart rate zones, or other fitness tracking metrics is mentioned.","If you'd rather stay as a PWer, there are ways to increase the challenge there. If you feel comfortable with it, you could try increasing speed. 0.1 makes a surprisingly large difference on inclines. You could also try increasing the inclines, go above what the coach calls out. Start out at +0.5% or +1%. I also start increasing the incline early on my PW days, so as soon as I hear the coach start their little spiel for the next push, I'm hitting the incline button so I'm closer to my desired incline when the push starts. If I know there's an AO coming (this requires paying a little more attention), I'll increase my incline even earlier but drop my speed enough to keep whatever feeling we're supposed to have (base or WR). This means I spend less time waiting for the treadmill to get to incline. Whichever option you choose, good luck! And don't be afraid of a little trial and error - that's usually the only way to figure speeds and inclines out.",workout strategies

1167,2023/6/3,HR and splats,Re: Zone 3- Green zone,Reddit,kjh3030,positive,The post provides a positive feedback on using incline to reach the orange heart rate zone faster and increase muscle engagement.,Take whatever the incline is for PW and go as much higher  as you need to hit orange about halfway through the interval.  I worked my way up to 15 all the time doing this.  Now I just adjust the speed.  The extra muscle engagement on big inclines gets your HR up faster.,workout strategies

You will hit different physical limits of discomfort, as your cardio vascular system improves, your legs may not have the endurance and you will feel discomfort here until the legs become accustomed. Try to get your splats in beggining of class, if you get tired that is fine and need to slow down to power walk that is fine, but if you get 1 splat point per class and then the next week you are getting 2 splat points per class that is progress. What I have found is after a 3 minute warm up go hard and get your heart rate into the high green/low orange. Some days I just dont have the legs or the mental discipline and I get 1-2 splats, other days everything comes together, I am rested, good nutrition, and mental discipline mesh and I get 16-20 splat points. Take it day-by-day and keep going consistently, slow imperceptible changes will occur and then you will look back in 6-12 months and be like damn I am in a lot better shape.",workout progress

And Im not just talking about getting in better shape. I mean being at higher heart rates becomes (somewhat) less unpleasant the more you do it. But I think its activity specific. Im FAR more comfortable at 165 bpm on a treadmill than I am as a novice swimmer at 135 bpm. The 135 bpm swimming feels like death; the 165 bpm on the tread feels like the nice part before I get going.
