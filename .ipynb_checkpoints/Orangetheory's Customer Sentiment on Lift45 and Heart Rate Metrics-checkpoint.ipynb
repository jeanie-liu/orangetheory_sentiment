       "'The studio I go to each Saturday for their 90 minute class has taken them off the schedule. My home studio has a regular 7 am class and then a Lift45 at 8:15. Have any of you ever tried doing this? I feel like it would be doable because I am used to doing a 90 once a week but wanted to know what others think! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I prefer to do the Lift45 before the regular 60. But yes its doable. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Oooo yes smart idea however that isn\\'t an option for me because of my work schedule! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Just know if you have a limited number of classes going the Lift + 60 will count as two classes and doing the 90 only counts as one. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you so much! Good to know! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I found some information that could be relevant to your question or topic.      Take a look at [previous conversations about pairing Lift 45 with a regular class](https://www.google.com/search?q=regular+60+lift45+site:reddit.com/r/orangetheory)      _This is an automated reply. If you would like to provide feedback, [please contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/orangetheory)._ ###END_OF_COMMENT### I do it at least twice a week. Just bring a small snack for the quick break in-between and you\\'re good to go ###END_OF_COMMENT### Oh awesome! Thank you! What are your fav between class snacks? ###END_OF_COMMENT### I love Aussie bites, protein bars or cashew clusters, all from Costco  ###END_OF_COMMENT### You can do both, its not like your taking away someone elses chance to do the workout. I wouldnt do two regular classes back to back. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you! ###END_OF_COMMENT### On Saturday, our class after Lift is typically ran as a 3g. So Ill do lift and then tread and rower in the 3g. Sometimes Ill stay for the floor, just depends how tough the lift class was. Either way, definitely doable! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I do this every Sunday too! I like the cardio between lifting. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thanks a million! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I do this every Sunday!  I like the 60 min first followed by the lift45.  I love it! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yay good to know! That\\'s what I will be doing! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I am a new OT client and I love it! I am also a nasm certified trainer etc just putting that here because its relevant. My suggestion is do the cardio first (regular class) and then the lift for fat loss. If you arent trying to lose weight and stay strong, lift first. just my opinion (: 100% doable if you have been doing the classes because they are not easy!! (: ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you so much! Great to hear from a trainer! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yep, I do it regularly on Saturday when I cant get to a 90.  But, it also forces me into an active rest day on Sunday. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you!! Sunday rest days are the best. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Technically, 60 min + Lift45 has \\\\~20-25 min break in between plus 5 min warm-up so very doable, although I prefer a 90 min because of continuity. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I usually do a 2G followed by lift once a week. I always take the day off from Orangetheory the next day, though - so if the next day is a benchmark or specialty class I really want to do, Ill just do the lift. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Smart to take a break! Thanks for the input! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yes! Just did this today  ###END_OF_COMMENT### I didn\\'t see it posted yet. I think I remembered everything. Good day to choose some challenging weights!   Warmup: the usual   Block 1: 6:30.  Bench low row (explosive) - 8 reps each side  TRX Pull Ups - 8 reps  Block 2: 6:30 Clean to front squat - 8 reps   Split stance pulse squats - 8 reps each side   Block 3: 6:30 S/A chest press (explosive) - 8 reps each side  TRX tricep extensions -8 reps  Block 4: 6:30 Alternating 90 degree pop squats - 8 total Split stance deadlifts- 8 reps each side   Finisher - 2 rounds  30 second low plank knee drives 30 second bicycle crunch 15 second rest ###END_OF_COMMENT### Except for those pop squats, this looks like a great class. Thank you for sharing. Im looking forward to this tomorrow. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Did this one earlier today, and yes can attest, aside from the pop squats it was great! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you!  I have this one in 3 hours ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thanks for the intel - this looks great! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you, looks like a good one! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you!! Excited to do this one tomorrow ###END_OF_COMMENT### I did TB2 today and loved it that I put myself on the WL for tomorrow, however, after reading this I think Ill keep my TB3 for tomorrow (I have TB2 on Friday again anyway) looks awesome, thanks for the intel. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Ive never been to lift 45 and Ive been out of otf for 3 months. Am I going to die? ###END_OF_COMMENT### Nope. Just lift a little lighter, go at your own pace, take rests when you need them, pay attention to form rather than rushing through, and modify when needed. (I should  pay more attention to my own advice, haha). I did lift after long breaks, and didnt die. I found it better for reintroduction than regular classes. ###END_OF_COMMENT### It started off a little chaotic but I think I liked it. I am kind of dead but not like after a regular class ###END_OF_COMMENT### Welcome back! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Just did this! Was a great class but Im pooped! ###END_OF_COMMENT### that sounds brutal ###END_OF_COMMENT### TRX tricep extensions are my fave!!! Looking forward to this tomorrow. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Love this template except for the pop squats. Guess Ill be doing split stance deadlifts for 6:30 mins  ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yes. My knees were like \"you know we\\'re 40 now, right? Why do you hate us?\" ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you for sharing!!!! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Havent seen this one posted yet and Im newer to OT so Im still not sure exactly how the Lift45 templates cycle through. Also apologies as I may screw up some of these exercise names lol  30 Min Block:  Each exercise was 6/8/10/12 reps, 4 rounds total. Also working unilaterally so 6 reps R, 6 reps L each exercise then up the reps.  DB Squat R/L DB Shoulder press R/L DB Lateral lunge R/L DB Standing one arm row R/L DB Single arm dumbbell swing R/L DB Bridge w/ single arm chest press R/L  If you made it through the 4 rounds then you moved on to three core exercises. Cant remember the first two because I didnt make it that far but the third was crunches  3 Min Finisher:   8/10/12 Jump squats 8/10/12 Push ups  If you made it through those three rounds then you held a plank until time was called.  I really liked this one overall! I enjoyed the 30 min block because it made it easier to go slow and lift heavy. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Oh I like this! I imagine the 30 minute block allows the coach to stress less about the template and they can move around watching everyones form. ###END_OF_COMMENT### 100%! The coach was definitely moving around correcting a bunch ###END_OF_COMMENT### Did this after 6am normal class today and really liked it a lot. Went unlimited with my membership a few weeks ago and have been trying to incorporate Lift 45 more, just tough because the times don\\'t work super well with my schedule or the waitlists are so long.  &#x200B;  Kept it slow and was able to use the same DB for all 4 rounds! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yoooo this template KICKED MY A$$!!! I got 24 splats and I never go for splats in a Lift, I usually stay in green!  Edit: For the finisher, we did squat jacks instead of jump squats. ###END_OF_COMMENT### I literally told my coach after class that template was an ass-kicker! Ive never gotten so many Lift splats ever! I know DCs system doesnt apply to Lift, but if it did, this would be a  for me. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Same! It was definitely for me too! ###END_OF_COMMENT### The other 2 core workouts were low plank squat jacks and back extensions ###END_OF_COMMENT### This was a great one!!  Thanks for the intel.  One of the core exercises was plank jacks ###END_OF_COMMENT### Just finished this Lift45 class and loved this old school type workout. Wish they would offer more of this kind of training with very minimal switching and 3-6 minute blocks ?  Was able to go heavy and take my time. ###END_OF_COMMENT### This is great, thank you! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Looks great!  Love the 30 minute block so we can just go to work. Thanks for sharing! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you!  The way my attention span is set up, Im switching to a regular classlooks good though.. ###END_OF_COMMENT### I have a short attention span too but really enjoyed this! I think because there were so many moves to cycle through ###END_OF_COMMENT### Um...what is\"DB\"? ###END_OF_COMMENT### Dumbbell ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you! Taking this tomorrow and wanted to see if I could manage so sore from todays 2G ###END_OF_COMMENT### I think you definitely can! You could even go lighter weight and just do a lot of focus on form ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you for sharing! Taking this one Wednesday. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you! ###END_OF_COMMENT### This was SO MUCH FUN! Solid burn without feeling completely fatigued. Sweat my butt off. Im tempted to take it again on Saturday, LOL! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Block 1 - Floor Side - 6 min * 8 DB Front Squat, Slow * 8 DB Reverse Grip Low Row, Slow  Block 1 - Tread Side - 6 min * 8 DB Transverse Goblet Squat, Slow * 8 DB Standing Rainbow, Slow  Block 2 - Floor - 6 min * 8 Each DB SL Deadlift, Slow * 8 DB Upper Cut, Slow  Block 2 - Tread Side - 6 min * 8 DB Hip Bridge, Slow * 8 DB Kneeling Tall Tricep Extension, Slow  Finisher * 2 Rounds:  - 30 Sec Sprinter Sit-Ups - 30 Sec Wide Mountain Climbers with Power - 30 Sec Rest ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yeesh the past couple of classes have been real lifting templates and I\\'m here for it  ###END_OF_COMMENT### One of the templates 2 weeks ago had 1 exercise per 3:45min block and I didnt know what to do with myself I was so happy! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Looks like the theme for this template is slow. Cannot wait for my muscles to protest ###END_OF_COMMENT### Just finished this one up- it was a dream Lift class.  Wish more were like this. ###END_OF_COMMENT### This was a good one. I got 12 splats and stayed in green mostly! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Tred/row side block 1 is a transverse goblet. Not a lateral.   Lateral kills me. lol I was thankful for the transverse. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yay  walking out the door to this right nowthank you so much! ###END_OF_COMMENT### This looks great! So excited for tomorrow ###END_OF_COMMENT### Looks like a really good one.thanks! ###END_OF_COMMENT### This was my first lift class and I loved it! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you!! ###END_OF_COMMENT### What is a good replacement for hip bridge? I don\\'t get much out of them even with 50 lbs and I\\'m not trying to use any more than that. Also, I feel like I\\'ve done them 3 times in the last week. ###END_OF_COMMENT### A coach recently said to take them really slow and instead of adding weight, doing it single leg ###END_OF_COMMENT### I did mine with 80 the other week and I felt that for days so maybe try even heavier? I was the same as you and didnt feel much with 50-60. I also like the other suggestion of one leg ###END_OF_COMMENT### My coach has me add a mini band on my thighs, youll definitely feel a burn!'"

    "    effective and enjoyable for their workout.\n",
