Ive never done any type of serious strength training so Im sure I couldve stood to gain pounds of muscle while looking more fit at that time.   Anyway, I slowly started gaining weight since 2021- not sure why besides working out less and drinking more. Scratch that, those two reasons are probably why LOL and have plateaued at my current weight.   My goal is to lose a significant amount of fat & build muscle. I know that the pounds are relative and theres so much that factors into it.   Im also trying to be significantly more diligent about tracking calories & protein.  My question is- if my goal for now is to slim down a good bit, would it be in my best interest to focus on the classic 2g classes and incorporate Lift45 a couple days a week or aim to incorporate more Lift classes? Im aiming for around 5-6 classes a week. Maybe someone here has been in a similar situation?
