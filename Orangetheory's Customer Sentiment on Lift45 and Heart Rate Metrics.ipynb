       "'The studio I go to each Saturday for their 90 minute class has taken them off the schedule. My home studio has a regular 7 am class and then a Lift45 at 8:15. Have any of you ever tried doing this? I feel like it would be doable because I am used to doing a 90 once a week but wanted to know what others think! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I prefer to do the Lift45 before the regular 60. But yes its doable. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Oooo yes smart idea however that isn\\'t an option for me because of my work schedule! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Just know if you have a limited number of classes going the Lift + 60 will count as two classes and doing the 90 only counts as one. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you so much! Good to know! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I found some information that could be relevant to your question or topic.      Take a look at [previous conversations about pairing Lift 45 with a regular class](https://www.google.com/search?q=regular+60+lift45+site:reddit.com/r/orangetheory)      _This is an automated reply. If you would like to provide feedback, [please contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/orangetheory)._ ###END_OF_COMMENT### I do it at least twice a week. Just bring a small snack for the quick break in-between and you\\'re good to go ###END_OF_COMMENT### Oh awesome! Thank you! What are your fav between class snacks? ###END_OF_COMMENT### I love Aussie bites, protein bars or cashew clusters, all from Costco  ###END_OF_COMMENT### You can do both, its not like your taking away someone elses chance to do the workout. I wouldnt do two regular classes back to back. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you! ###END_OF_COMMENT### On Saturday, our class after Lift is typically ran as a 3g. So Ill do lift and then tread and rower in the 3g. Sometimes Ill stay for the floor, just depends how tough the lift class was. Either way, definitely doable! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I do this every Sunday too! I like the cardio between lifting. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thanks a million! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I do this every Sunday!  I like the 60 min first followed by the lift45.  I love it! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yay good to know! That\\'s what I will be doing! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I am a new OT client and I love it! I am also a nasm certified trainer etc just putting that here because its relevant. My suggestion is do the cardio first (regular class) and then the lift for fat loss. If you arent trying to lose weight and stay strong, lift first. just my opinion (: 100% doable if you have been doing the classes because they are not easy!! (: ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you so much! Great to hear from a trainer! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yep, I do it regularly on Saturday when I cant get to a 90.  But, it also forces me into an active rest day on Sunday. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you!! Sunday rest days are the best. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Technically, 60 min + Lift45 has \\\\~20-25 min break in between plus 5 min warm-up so very doable, although I prefer a 90 min because of continuity. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you! ###END_OF_COMMENT### I usually do a 2G followed by lift once a week. I always take the day off from Orangetheory the next day, though - so if the next day is a benchmark or specialty class I really want to do, Ill just do the lift. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Smart to take a break! Thanks for the input! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yes! Just did this today  ###END_OF_COMMENT### I didn\\'t see it posted yet. I think I remembered everything. Good day to choose some challenging weights!   Warmup: the usual   Block 1: 6:30.  Bench low row (explosive) - 8 reps each side  TRX Pull Ups - 8 reps  Block 2: 6:30 Clean to front squat - 8 reps   Split stance pulse squats - 8 reps each side   Block 3: 6:30 S/A chest press (explosive) - 8 reps each side  TRX tricep extensions -8 reps  Block 4: 6:30 Alternating 90 degree pop squats - 8 total Split stance deadlifts- 8 reps each side   Finisher - 2 rounds  30 second low plank knee drives 30 second bicycle crunch 15 second rest ###END_OF_COMMENT### Except for those pop squats, this looks like a great class. Thank you for sharing. Im looking forward to this tomorrow. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Did this one earlier today, and yes can attest, aside from the pop squats it was great! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you!  I have this one in 3 hours ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thanks for the intel - this looks great! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you, looks like a good one! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you!! Excited to do this one tomorrow ###END_OF_COMMENT### I did TB2 today and loved it that I put myself on the WL for tomorrow, however, after reading this I think Ill keep my TB3 for tomorrow (I have TB2 on Friday again anyway) looks awesome, thanks for the intel. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Ive never been to lift 45 and Ive been out of otf for 3 months. Am I going to die? ###END_OF_COMMENT### Nope. Just lift a little lighter, go at your own pace, take rests when you need them, pay attention to form rather than rushing through, and modify when needed. (I should  pay more attention to my own advice, haha). I did lift after long breaks, and didnt die. I found it better for reintroduction than regular classes. ###END_OF_COMMENT### It started off a little chaotic but I think I liked it. I am kind of dead but not like after a regular class ###END_OF_COMMENT### Welcome back! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Just did this! Was a great class but Im pooped! ###END_OF_COMMENT### that sounds brutal ###END_OF_COMMENT### TRX tricep extensions are my fave!!! Looking forward to this tomorrow. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Love this template except for the pop squats. Guess Ill be doing split stance deadlifts for 6:30 mins  ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yes. My knees were like \"you know we\\'re 40 now, right? Why do you hate us?\" ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you for sharing!!!! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Havent seen this one posted yet and Im newer to OT so Im still not sure exactly how the Lift45 templates cycle through. Also apologies as I may screw up some of these exercise names lol  30 Min Block:  Each exercise was 6/8/10/12 reps, 4 rounds total. Also working unilaterally so 6 reps R, 6 reps L each exercise then up the reps.  DB Squat R/L DB Shoulder press R/L DB Lateral lunge R/L DB Standing one arm row R/L DB Single arm dumbbell swing R/L DB Bridge w/ single arm chest press R/L  If you made it through the 4 rounds then you moved on to three core exercises. Cant remember the first two because I didnt make it that far but the third was crunches  3 Min Finisher:   8/10/12 Jump squats 8/10/12 Push ups  If you made it through those three rounds then you held a plank until time was called.  I really liked this one overall! I enjoyed the 30 min block because it made it easier to go slow and lift heavy. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Oh I like this! I imagine the 30 minute block allows the coach to stress less about the template and they can move around watching everyones form. ###END_OF_COMMENT### 100%! The coach was definitely moving around correcting a bunch ###END_OF_COMMENT### Did this after 6am normal class today and really liked it a lot. Went unlimited with my membership a few weeks ago and have been trying to incorporate Lift 45 more, just tough because the times don\\'t work super well with my schedule or the waitlists are so long.  &#x200B;  Kept it slow and was able to use the same DB for all 4 rounds! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yoooo this template KICKED MY A$$!!! I got 24 splats and I never go for splats in a Lift, I usually stay in green!  Edit: For the finisher, we did squat jacks instead of jump squats. ###END_OF_COMMENT### I literally told my coach after class that template was an ass-kicker! Ive never gotten so many Lift splats ever! I know DCs system doesnt apply to Lift, but if it did, this would be a  for me. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Same! It was definitely for me too! ###END_OF_COMMENT### The other 2 core workouts were low plank squat jacks and back extensions ###END_OF_COMMENT### This was a great one!!  Thanks for the intel.  One of the core exercises was plank jacks ###END_OF_COMMENT### Just finished this Lift45 class and loved this old school type workout. Wish they would offer more of this kind of training with very minimal switching and 3-6 minute blocks ?  Was able to go heavy and take my time. ###END_OF_COMMENT### This is great, thank you! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Looks great!  Love the 30 minute block so we can just go to work. Thanks for sharing! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you!  The way my attention span is set up, Im switching to a regular classlooks good though.. ###END_OF_COMMENT### I have a short attention span too but really enjoyed this! I think because there were so many moves to cycle through ###END_OF_COMMENT### Um...what is\"DB\"? ###END_OF_COMMENT### Dumbbell ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you! Taking this tomorrow and wanted to see if I could manage so sore from todays 2G ###END_OF_COMMENT### I think you definitely can! You could even go lighter weight and just do a lot of focus on form ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you for sharing! Taking this one Wednesday. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you! ###END_OF_COMMENT### This was SO MUCH FUN! Solid burn without feeling completely fatigued. Sweat my butt off. Im tempted to take it again on Saturday, LOL! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Block 1 - Floor Side - 6 min * 8 DB Front Squat, Slow * 8 DB Reverse Grip Low Row, Slow  Block 1 - Tread Side - 6 min * 8 DB Transverse Goblet Squat, Slow * 8 DB Standing Rainbow, Slow  Block 2 - Floor - 6 min * 8 Each DB SL Deadlift, Slow * 8 DB Upper Cut, Slow  Block 2 - Tread Side - 6 min * 8 DB Hip Bridge, Slow * 8 DB Kneeling Tall Tricep Extension, Slow  Finisher * 2 Rounds:  - 30 Sec Sprinter Sit-Ups - 30 Sec Wide Mountain Climbers with Power - 30 Sec Rest ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yeesh the past couple of classes have been real lifting templates and I\\'m here for it  ###END_OF_COMMENT### One of the templates 2 weeks ago had 1 exercise per 3:45min block and I didnt know what to do with myself I was so happy! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Looks like the theme for this template is slow. Cannot wait for my muscles to protest ###END_OF_COMMENT### Just finished this one up- it was a dream Lift class.  Wish more were like this. ###END_OF_COMMENT### This was a good one. I got 12 splats and stayed in green mostly! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Tred/row side block 1 is a transverse goblet. Not a lateral.   Lateral kills me. lol I was thankful for the transverse. ###END_OF_COMMENT### Yay  walking out the door to this right nowthank you so much! ###END_OF_COMMENT### This looks great! So excited for tomorrow ###END_OF_COMMENT### Looks like a really good one.thanks! ###END_OF_COMMENT### This was my first lift class and I loved it! ###END_OF_COMMENT### Thank you!! ###END_OF_COMMENT### What is a good replacement for hip bridge? I don\\'t get much out of them even with 50 lbs and I\\'m not trying to use any more than that. Also, I feel like I\\'ve done them 3 times in the last week. ###END_OF_COMMENT### A coach recently said to take them really slow and instead of adding weight, doing it single leg ###END_OF_COMMENT### I did mine with 80 the other week and I felt that for days so maybe try even heavier? I was the same as you and didnt feel much with 50-60. I also like the other suggestion of one leg ###END_OF_COMMENT### My coach has me add a mini band on my thighs, youll definitely feel a burn!'"

Lately they've allowed more than 16 people to sign up so all floor stations had members plus like 4-5 people who start near the rowers. When we switch those 4-5 people take stations 1-5 and then those folks move to rower side of the gym. So when you don't have a designated floor section you have no choice but to ask people to borrow weights. We had 4 extra people but 2 of them borrowed from mine! They asked and we're nice and all that so it's not a rant against them we'll except one girl who borrowed 20s said she'd bring them back but never did lol. I was able to work with what I could find near me, but if I wanted to go 20s no one near me had them free anyway so it was just a little annoying and I blame it more of this new format than anything.

If I can't find any (after asking the coach too), I either try to push forward with a heavier weight or go much slower with a lighter weight.

      "    \"text\": \"Sounds like your goal is to efficiently lose fat and gain muscle. I'm not a registered dietician, but like others have said..eat at a caloric deficit and aim for more protein throughout the day (ie: 30-40 g per meal. I'm currently aiming for 1 g protein per lb of body weight). This will help stimulate mTOR aka muscle growth. Many studies on pubmed have shown that eating more protein while eating in a caloric deficit will help maintain muscle mass and result in more fat loss compared to lower protein diets (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26817506/). More Lift45 classes make sense for your goal. If your form is great at OTF, don't be afraid to lift heavy and until failure. If it's not that great, make sure your coach can give you feedback, otherwise you can injure yourself. If you're interested in learning more about protein and body composition, I love this podcast! https://youtu.be/BqmG2y4IeY8 Keep in mind that body recomp will take time, so try to focus on NSV (ie: waist measurements, how your clothes fit, how fast you can run, how heavy you can lift, etc). If you can incorporate daily walks and eating more whole foods that will help too. :)\",\n",

Depending on how busy my Sunday is sometimes I end up going to a studio that does Lift then Regular and sometimes I am at a studio that does Regular then Lift. Either way you can't go wrong you just have to prepare yourself and set some expectations. 1H45Ms of working out is a long time so I like to prep my body and my mind. I usually will take around 3/4 of my regular preworkout serving before the first class and then take the final 1/4 before the second class to keep me going. I also enjoy taking a small snack or a bottle with protein in it to keep me going for the next class. Additionally, I think it is important to prep your mind and determine what your goal is with the two classes. For example, I usually treat the first class (no matter if it is Lift or Regular) as a sort of long warm-up for the next class. Then the second class is really where I start going hard. For this reason I usually prefer Lift to be the second class as I personally think that it is more important to be warm/prepped for a Lift class compared to a Regular class but that is just me.\",\n",

Going back to that would decrease my chances of wanting to go some weeks (like when I feel I've done enough leg work for the week).

Plus, I feel like building strength is a much more important goal for me now than burning calories. Funnily enough, I have burned almost as many calories in the Lift45 classes as I did in the regular 2G classes, and I always get over 12 splats in them (not that it really matters). It's interesting cause no one else in the class seems to get anywhere near as many calories burnt or splats. I guess I'll chalk that up to my being really weak lol. The treadmill has never felt very challenging to me. Of course I could always run faster with steeper inclines, but I feel like I'm pretty satisfied with my speed and incline on the tread, and I'm not trying to lose weight. When I did 2G classes, most of my orange was in the floor/rower portion, and I stayed mostly green on the tread except when doing AOs. I like that the coaches provide more feedback on form in the Lift45 classes cause they're not so busy running back and forth between the treads and the floor. I will probably go back to 2G classes in the winter when it's too crappy outside to want to run, but for now it's working really well for me to just do Lift45 and go for runs outside. The only thing I feel like I'm missing out on is the rower (even though there's not much rowing in 2G classes) but I HATE the rower even though I know it's good for me, so I'm not shedding too many tears about that. Also I've noticed in Lift45 there is more of a focus on lifting heavy, proper form, and pacing yourself appropriately, whereas in the 2G and esp 3G classes I feel like people are racing to get through the movements with terrible form and not nearly enough time under tension.\",\n",

Lately they've allowed more than 16 people to sign up so all floor stations had members plus like 4-5 people who start near the rowers. When we switch those 4-5 people take stations 1-5 and then those folks move to rower side of the gym. So when you don't have a designated floor section you have no choice but to ask people to borrow weights. We had 4 extra people but 2 of them borrowed from mine! They asked and we're nice and all that so it's not a rant against them we'll except one girl who borrowed 20s said she'd bring them back but never did lol. I was able to work with what I could find near me, but if I wanted to go 20s no one near me had them free anyway so it was just a little annoying and I blame it more of this new format than anything.

       "3    Before in Lift45 classes we would all have a station and do Floor side first then Rower side exercises. Lately they've allowed more than 16 people to sign up so all floor stations had members plus like 4-5 people who start near the rowers. When we switch those 4-5 people take stations 1-5 and then those folks move to rower side of the gym. So when you don't have a designated floor section you have no choice but to ask people to borrow weights. We had 4 extra people but 2 of them borrowed from mine! They asked and we're nice and all that so it's not a rant against them we'll except one girl who borrowed 20s said she'd bring them back but never did lol. I was able to work with what I could find near me, but if I wanted to go 20s no one near me had them free anyway so it was just a little annoying and I blame it more of this new format than anything. Anyone else have this format at their lift?   \n",

       "'How do I burn more calories? I usually get between 375-400 calories per class. My splats are usually 13-20, and then green the rest of the time (well, maybe 3-4 minutes blue). Is there something I can do? #END# 1) ignore calories burned.  Its not that accurate.   2) youre supposed to spend most of the time in green with 12-20 splat points (orange and red).   It sounds like youre doing exactly what is expected for an OTF workout. #END# If you want to burn more calories, eat a little less. Like literally 5 bites is the difference here  The benefit of working out isnt and has never been calories burned #END# Without knowing anything about you, it sounds like youre probably right about where you should be. Im a 37F, 54 120lbs, in really good shape. At OTF, I spend around 15-20 min in the orange or red, and burn around 425 calories according to OTF (my Apple Watch reads in the high 300s). My fianc is 61 170 and burns about twice what I do. There is no way I could get close to his calorie burnit would be unhealthy. I just dont have that many calories to burn in a hour.   Im an instructor at another group fitness program, and get 25+ splats there and close to 500 calories in an hour and I am absolutely exhausted afterward.   If your body composition is more muscle, youre going to naturally burn more calories at rest than someone of the same size/weight with less muscle. So, thats a way to increase calorie burn, but you wont be able to see that data on an app. #END# Go faster. Lift heavier. Row with higher watts. More work is more calories burned. #END# Something that helps me burn more calories is strength focused rowing. When no direction is given as to how to row, I usually go low stroke rate with explosive leg drive with full knee extension and a pause in full knee extension. And I try to drive my watts up as high as possible with a 1 stroke focus.   Today I went to a 2G and we had those 2 90 sec rows as well as the 10 stroke row repeat and  I really focused on my leg drive and had a higher calorie burn than my normal which happened during and because of my row work.   Lifting heavier also helps burn more calories.   Taking advantage of floor power moves with as much explosiveness or power as I can safely manage also helps me burn more calories.   I am a very slow power walker and frequently earn more splats rowing and lofting than on the treads. #END# Same here. I can relate. #END# From what I can figure:  Be male. If you are male, weigh more. If you are female, weigh less (even if it\\'s because you\\'re shorter). Get younger. Have a higher average heart rate.  Only the last one can be controlled and even then only partly. According to their formula, I burn more than average for my age because my max HR is a few beats higher than average. That\\'s not something that can be controlled- it\\'s just how my body is.  You can go harder and have more time in the high green, orange, and red, but too much time elevated isn\\'t really a great idea. Avoiding gray and blue (starting the weight block once it\\'s demoed, rowing once you get to the router) does help but for the most part the formula is based on things outside the workout. #END# A calorie not consumed is even better than a calorie burned. What is your end goal? as the number itself doesn\\'t matter without context. #END# Agree with the comment about ignoring calories in general because they are really not very accurate.  But if you are still interested then make sure your weight, age, and gender are correct in the system because those all affect calorie calculation. #END# You burn more calories (outside of otf) by increasing your TDEE. #END# TDEE?? #END# Total daily energy expenditure.   So to translate, this helpful response said: \"burn more calories outside of otf by burning more calories in the day.\"  Edit: the order. #END# Take walks, stretch often, stand up from your desk often, take the stairs instead of elevator, park farther away, play with the kids instead of watching, do light yoga, dance while you empty the dishwasher etc :) #END# I try and ignore the calories though I know its so hard to do! I am 39, 54 and 225 lbs- I burn anywhere between 320-375, its very rare that I hit 400 calories, the other day it was 280! Even on a good day for me I am at least 100 calories lower than anyone else in the class. I have a feeling when I turn 40 (next month) I will probably start loosing even less, even with the same effort. Ive lost 60isj lbs of fat since I began OTF and my calorie burn has always been the same. My Apple Watch on the other hand shows I burn a good 200 more calories than the burn'"

      "1) Calorie burn: Customers are discussing ways to increase their calorie burn during Orangetheory workouts. They mention strategies such as strength-focused rowing, lifting heavier weights, and performing power moves on the floor. These strategies are seen as effective in helping them burn more calories.\n",
      "2) Splat points: Customers mention earning splat points during their workouts, which indicates that they are spending time in the orange and red heart rate zones. They view earning splat points as a positive achievement and a sign of an effective workout.\n",
      "3) Heart rate zones: Customers mention spending most of their time in the green heart rate zone, which is considered challenging. They see this as a positive indicator of their workout intensity and effort.\n",
      "4) Fitness level: Customers discuss their fitness levels and how it affects their calorie burn. They mention that having more muscle mass can naturally increase calorie burn, even at rest. This is seen as a positive aspect of their fitness journey.\n",

They mention that the calorie burn displayed by Orangetheory may differ from other devices, such as Apple Watch. This is seen as a negative aspect of the tracking system.\n",
      "2) Limited calorie burn: Customers mention that they struggle to reach a high calorie burn during their workouts. They compare their calorie burn to others in the class and feel that they are burning fewer calories. This is seen as a negative aspect of their workout experience.\n",
      "3) Age-related decrease in calorie burn: Customers express concerns about their calorie burn decreasing as they age. They anticipate that their calorie burn may decrease even with the same effort. This is seen as a negative aspect of the aging process.\n",
      "4) Uncontrollable factors affecting calorie burn: Customers mention that factors such as gender, weight, and age can affect calorie burn, but these factors are beyond their control. They feel that the formula used to calculate calorie burn is based on factors outside of the workout, which is seen as a negative aspect of the tracking system.\n",
      "5) Inaccurate calorie measurement: Customers mention that calorie tracking is not very accurate and should be ignored. They believe that focusing on the number of calories burned is not important without considering other contextual factors. This is seen as a negative aspect of calorie tracking.\n"

       "'2 questions: I feel like Im killing myself, but Im staying in the green way too much.  I know that they mess with the heart rate monitors, but is that the only way to get back into the Orange or is it actually more beneficial to stay in the green? For example the last class I was 41 minutes in the green 10 minutes in orange, and the rest was blue and gray.  Q2 I look up the class plan and I kind of get over excited and I feel like when I start I have this adrenaline rush and it very quickly leaves and I dont do as well as I would think I would do? I like to know ahead of time because sometimes it helps me figure out if its a rest day or not and I was just trying to figure out if Im in a plateau and if so what to do to make it different. #END# Someone will likely articulate this better but you are likely improving your conditioning to the point that you are staying in the green even with your increased efforts which is not a problem. I rarely get the 12 splats anymore and stay in the green but my metrics are still where I feel like Im improving. #END# I agree with the conqueror #END# Agreed, Zero, one or two splats usually.and still 700+ most days.  If you are working hard, come home drained, and were mostly green then your heart fitness is strong. I just a circulatory system problem a week ago: clots, lungs, heart. Had an ultrasound of my heart and the cardiologist thought he was getting some business until he saw the scan.. it just seemed to healthy to strong to explain or contribute to my other issues. All thanks to 5-6 days a week of OTF and some good genetics I suppose. #END# Your recovery rate is also better. When I first started I would be in the orange for longer durations. Now once the block is done, I drop back into the green pretty quick. I used to get 25-30 in the orange, now its 5-10. #END# Exactly this #END# Being excited about exercise is a huge win in my book. If you didn\\'t have a monitor to use to judge yourself,  would you feel good about your workout?   I know OTF builds their premise around splats, but the benefits of exercising aren\\'t dependent on how many \"splats\" you get. Cardiovascular health, functional strength, and mobility help us live healthy lifetimes. Longitudinal fitness studies and meta-analysis demonstrate that it\\'s consistent movement/ regular exercise are game changers for positive health outcomes.  Be proud that you are gaining strength and endurance,  and don\\'t let splats steal your joy! #END# Im in the same boat. I used to get 15-20 splat points easily. Now Im killing my workouts and lucky if I get 10. I dont know your health journey so cant speak to your experience directly. For me though its because my recovery time is much shorter. I drop to green/blue pretty quickly during walking recoveries if I dont start jogging. I sort of stopped paying attention to my splats for that very reason. As long as I am pushing myself I know Im getting a good workout in. Splats are nice but not a determining factor in my overall health journey. #END# First, keep in mind that green is still the fat burning zone, so although youre not hitting as much after burn youre still getting a great workout even in the green.  That said, Ive noticed Im spending much more time in the green now because my endurance, strength, and stamina have all increased dramatically in the three months since I first joined. I *never* used to get back down to the green during WRs on the treadmill when I first started, now I easily get down to the green (and sometimes even blue) during a 45 second WR.  If you can, increase your speeds, increase your weights, etc. so youre working harder and youll start to see more time in the orange again! #END# Where do you typically start? Tread, rower, or floor? I know lots of studios allow you to pick where you start, is that true for you? At my studio, we are assigned by the SA, but it is based upon the order in which we sign up for classes, so I try to register as early as possible so I can start on the tread.   I have realized that I get the most splats overall when I start on the treads. My splats drop off some when I start on the rower in a 3G, and drastically when I start on the floor. This is because the treadmill gets my heart rate up into the green and keeps it up for a sustained period of time, and I will sustain that the rest of class if I start there. So then, when I do things that are harder exertion, even on the floor, the spike gets me into the orange. On the flipside, when I start on the floor, Im often going from gray or low blue into green when my heart rate spikes even though the intensity feels the same.   For example, I started on the treads and got 30 splats in yesterdays class, which had a lot of walking recovery, mixed in with 10 all outs. I pushed myself hard to run as fast as possible during the all-outs, and I was cruising in the high green when I switched to the rower, and the 50 stroke row just kept that going. So by the time I got to the floor, which was very low intensity, and did not feel difficult, even small spikes kept me going back into orange. I would not have rated yesterdays work out as insane even though I got a ton of splats. However, today I started on the floor and only got 9 splats for the class even though I felt like it was a harder overall template both with the floor work (especially the first block), and the exhausting inclines on the treads.   It may be totally unrelated to your situation, but I thought it worth mentioning that where youre starting may be affecting your total splats. #END# I skip the rest/ walking recovery\\'s, yesterday\\'s class for example, even at a top all out speed if I am only there for 30 seconds or a minute, I won\\'t get out of green, so I run base pace instead of walking, it still bumps me down to the green, but I\\'m more primed to hit orange when we push or all out. #END# As long as you are pushing yourself and not being somewhat complacent, that is the important thing.   For me, it is pretty easy to tell myself not to go hard and stay in my comfort zone.   Sometimes, I need that extra motivation or push to go faster or lift heavier #END# Focus less on the zones themselves, and look at your *actual* heart rate. When you are in the green, during cardio especially, where is your heart rate? Is it at the top end of your green zone? For example, I push from green to orange at 142. So, if I spend a lot of time at 140-141, that will look like a lot of green zone time on my report. But if I push up to 142-144 and just hang there, Ill rack up the splats without doing much more work or burning many more calories - that 2-4 bpm is negligible. So, instead of obsessing over zones and splats, look at the actual data behind it and use that data in class to meet your goals. For me, thats knowing that when I drop into the low 130s during a walking recovery, its time to pick it back up to base pace again. Its also knowing how long my heart rate takes to climb to 150 at certain speeds, and bumping my paces up to get myself where I want to be. I like to hang out at the top end of orange on push/base to push and jump to red on an all out. #END# Supposedly being in the green is where you burn more fat. (A coach told me that) I was out for about 4 wks because of a minor surgery and when I got back my orange threshold went up like 13 points! So I have to be at 159 now to enter the Orange. So I only have like 4-5 points if Im lucky per class. Oh, And Im a 61 yr old F. Go figure  #END# Context is key here. How often do you go? What is your age and any other metrics you would feel sharing.   If you were going 7 days a weeks for 2 years. Youre likely in great condition and your body will not be in the orange that easy.   If you go once a week on and off. Then you should consider moving your Push and All out up from where you are setting them.   A lot of variables here to consider. #END# I\\'m pretty analytical and I agree with you. I am not going to comment because I think i might confuse more by accident haha #END# Same!!! I can totally relate and would love folks opinion. #END# Your workout is your workout, regardless of the arbitrary coloration system. #END# So they adjusted my HR a few months ago. I went from 20-25 splats per class to 0-3. The thing is, my HR is a still the same whether OTF decides if Im in green vs orange/red.  Im still working as hardmaybe harder since I tend to get anxious when Im in the red zone.    With that being said, I did contact them via the app and they adjusted my HR (which was set to 196 ) so Im back to 20+ splats per class. #END# Is anyone else here an asthmatic? Ive noticed that on the days I pre-medicate and take my inhaler prior to working out at OTF, my heart rate seems to be higher and I get more splats? It gets higher faster and stays higher longer. Anyone else experience this?   Not looking for medical advice, just wondering if anyone else has noticed the same, since its the only workout I do thats based on actively managing your exertion based on heart rate. :) #END# Albuterol is a beta 2 agonist and one of the side effects (technically just an action of the medication working on beta 2 receptors in the heart in addition to the bronchi) is increased heart rate. #END# Beyond my level of understanding, but totally makes sense. ;) #END# Just saying its a known side effect of the medication, so yes its normal for your HR to be up #END# Thank you! I loved math, hated science and bio in school!  #END# I have MILD exercise induced and generally skip my inhaler, but the result is that I clear my throat for the entire time Im in orange and red. Which Im sure is annoying. #END# Im starting to think I have this bc I will need to clear my throat the entire time and it makes me so self conscious lol #END# Maybe mention it to your doctor! If they suggest an inhaler and it helps you it\\'s kind of a game changer for the treads. #END# Do you do anything that has helped?  I use my inhaler before class but clear my throat during the tread block.  I am completely asymptomatic at other times, so I havent approached my doctor to change my med. #END# I have mild exercise induced asthma but hat taking my inhaler before class so I pop a menthol cough drop in my mouth just before the tread block and dont have to clear my throat when I do that. #END# This, or very strong mint gum while on the treadmill. #END# Wow what a good tip. I am definitely giving it a try. Thanks! #END# Sometimes when the air quality is bad I use my inhaler and take DayQuil. I also Flonase and that helps for the drip to come out your nose and not down the back of your throat #END# Yes, i developed asthma last year . I turn off the tread screen so I dont have to see my heart explode. I absolutely cannot get back to green unless I get off the tread.   And I was a pretty good runner before the asthma so getting back to green wasnt a problem.  As someone else said, I can skip the inhaler but Ill be clearing my throat the whole time. #END# Mild asthma but yeah if I take my inhaler pre class then my heart rate is higher #END# Like another person mentioned, high heart rate is a pretty expected effect of rescue inhalers like albuterol .Think that you\\'re triggering a mini version of \"fight or flight\" that opens your airways and also increases your heart rate.  As a lifelong asthmatic, the biggest thing I can advocate for is a combination corticosteroid and long acting bronchodilator (Symbicort, Advair, Breo are examples in the US). These bad boys are more preventative maintenance. In contrast, albuterol is a short acting bronchodilator, more used for responding to attacks after they occur. When I\\'m taking my preventative meds regularly, I usually don\\'t need albuterol. Obviously I\\'ll take a high HR over wheezing, but I\\'d rather but need it at all. #END# Yes.  I experience the same.  I use Breo one hour before class and Albuterol 15min before class :) #END# Yep, Im Albuterol 15 min before. Ive been ok without taking it lately, but did yesterday and my HR was sooooo high #END# Yes! I take my inhaler 20-30 minutes beforehand. My HR gets up easily and I feel a little shaky or easily nauseous some days. Sometimes food or electrolytes in my water help but I do have to moderate my efforts knowing it affects me that way. #END# Yes, Ive had asthma since I started 9 years ago. Im on trelegy for the last 2 years when I got Covid . My asthma is better controlled now so I try to avoid my inhaler before class so my heart rate is now lower #END# Yes! I really notice it when I take my advair. I have found that I can work out without taking my inhaler, as long as I take my allergy meds I am ok.  I keep my albuterol as a rescue inhaler, but when I first went on advair I was getting 30-40 splats a class. #END# Yeah Im constantly getting 30-40, its weird. I was in a smaller class on Thursday and the coach kept eyeing my heart rate to see if I was doing anything to recover  and trust me, I was trying to dial it in! #END# I always take Salbutamol before class so I have nothing to compare to but my heart rate recovery seems to be quite quick (e.g. usually one of the first to get back to the green zone after an all out). Maybe it would be even quicker without! Then again I\\'d be having an asthma attack so maybe not!  #END# Former competitive athlete with exercise-induced asthma here. I haven\\'t had to take it at all with OTF, but in my former racing days, I definitely would take it before our races. It prevented me from dying, but my HR was never any better or worse. #END# I do the pre workout inhaler. I do mine about an hour before I go and hy heart rate is fine. A few times I\\'ve done it in the lobby right before class and my heart rate was high. Not sure if it was the albuterol or that I was already feeling tight that day. #END# Increased heart rate is a common side effect of the medication. Normally lasts 30-60 minutes after you use inhaler. Read your insert.  Youll see it there. '"

When no direction is given as to how to row, I usually go low stroke rate with explosive leg drive with full knee extension and a pause in full knee extension. And I try to drive my watts up as high as possible with a 1 stroke focus.   Today I went to a 2G and we had those 2 90 sec rows as well as the 10 stroke row repeat and  I really focused on my leg drive and had a higher calorie burn than my normal which happened during and because of my row work.   Lifting heavier also helps burn more calories.   Taking advantage of floor power moves with as much explosiveness or power as I can safely manage also helps me burn more calories.   I am a very slow power walker and frequently earn more splats rowing and lofting than on the treads.'},\n",

Avoiding gray and blue (starting the weight block once it's demoed, rowing once you get to the router) does help but for the most part the formula is based on things outside the workout.\"},\n",

Today I went to a 2G and we had those 2 90 sec rows as well as the 10 stroke row repeat and I really focused on my leg drive and had a higher calorie burn than my normal which happened during and because of my row work.
